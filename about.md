Hi! I'm jon, a Web Devloper working in Bridgend for a great company called [Comgem](comgem.com). 

Before I joined Comgem I was a Mac guy and built PHP/Wordpress sites. I have now joined the darkside and moved to Windows and use C# and ASP MVC and Webforms on a daily basis.

This site will hopefully point you in the direction of useful tools and tips, and maybe even provide some of its own.

### Projects

[SQuery](http://treefishuk.github.io/SQuery)
This is a light weight alternative to JQuery I put together.

### Skills

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* C#
* ASP MVC
* Webforms
