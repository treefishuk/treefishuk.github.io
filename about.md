Hi! I'm jon, a Web Devloper working in Bridgend for a great company called [Comgem](comgem.com). 

Before I joined Comgem I was a Mac guy and built PHP/Wordpress sites. I have now joined the darkside and moved to Windows and use C# and ASP MVC and Webforms on a daily basis.

Having transitioned from Mac to Windows, from PHP to C# and Wordpres to Umbraco I am going to try and write the occasional article to help anyone who is in a similar position to me. This site will hopefully point people in the direction for useful tools and tips, and may be even provide some of its own.

### Projects

This is a light weight alternative to JQuery I put together.

### Skills
