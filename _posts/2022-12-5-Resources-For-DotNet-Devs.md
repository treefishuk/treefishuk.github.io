--- 


If you are new to dotnet, or want to stay up to date with whats going on in and arround that space there are some great resources out there, to help you on your journey. This article is a curated list of the resources that I have found useful over the last few years. I hope you will find value in them too.

## Podcasts

### [DotNetRocks!](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/) 
So many of the tools and techniques I use on a daily basis I first heard about on this show. Carl and Richard are wonderful hosts and the show is fantastic. The "better know a framework" segmaent, with its wonderfully bonkers intro has sent me down many a rabit hole of discovery.

## Blogs

### [The Morning Brew](https://blog.cwa.me.uk/)
Chris Alcock produces a curated list of awesome blog articles for dotnet devs most days. There are a lot of blogs out there but Chris consistantly seems to find the best stuff to list. 

### [C# Digest](https://csharpdigest.net/)
Abother curated list of awesome blog articles for dotnet devs, this one produced on a weekly bases. You can have the list e-mailed out to you or subscribe to the RSS feed. 

## YouTube Channels

### [Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas)
Nick showcases practical tools, techniques and patterns, that often make me rethink my approach to the way I code. Well worth subscribing.

### [Code Opinion](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeOpinion)
Code opinion is a great channel with Derek Comartin discussing coding patterns and providing practical examples of clean coding. Lots of good stuff on Domain driven design, CQRS and message queues. 

### [.NET](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnet)
A channel from Microsoft. Great for 101  tutorial videos and the best place to catch up on Keynotes and sessions from .Net Conf.
